			<p> There is one cardinal rule in the Woods family: stay out of the woods surrounding the house. Heath, the third of the four children, has always had the most difficulty following rules. Today, he will break the one rule and accidently lead two of his siblings between two odd trees and into the fantastic world of Arreth. There they will be chased by trolls, ride on the backs of enormous griffins, meet an eccentric old wizard, a fairy, and a cat-sized dragon, all while struggling to reunite their family and learning about a prophecy that says one of them may or may not be the one to end the ultimate evil plaguing this world that is so much like our own and yet so completely different. The Woods of Arreth is an epic Fantasy adventure that at its heart is a story about the importance of family. </p>

			<p>The epic family adventure that began with The Woods of Arreth continues! Three months have passed since the Woods children discovered the world of Arreth and learned that one of them may be the prophesied child who can bring about the downfall of King Malved Winham and free the kingdom of Calsinor from his evil rule. But before they can go to war against Winham, they need an army. While Caleb Woods travels with their father to enlist the aid of the Dwarves of Ancor, his sister and brothers travel with their mother deep under the surface on an important mission of their own. Unknown to the Woods family, however, someone close to them is not what they seem to be. Journey with the Woods family as they continue their adventures, full of mythical creatures, adventure, and betrayal.</p>

			<p>The War to free the kingdom of Calsinor and bring Light back to the Western Kingdoms draws nearer! House Wudsaress has its army, a combination of the Griffin Riders, the Haven Guard, and the armies of Middonai and Ancor. But before the War for Calsinor’s freedom can begin, tragedy strikes! The Woods Family finds itself divided once again, falling prey to Malved Winham’s evil schemes. While Matthew and Rebecca race to rescue two of their children, the other two undertake a secret quest to find the one part of their army still missing—joined by some old friends and a few new ones. The Final Battle for Calsinor draws closer, but to win, the Woods children will need to find courage in themselves, trust in family, and the aid of The Guardians of Griffinholme!</p>

			<p>The War for Calsinor nears it’s end! But, it is evil King Malved Winham who stands on the edge of triumph, not the Griffin Riders and the Forces of Arreth Haven! The magical barrier protecting Arreth Vale has fallen and evil King Malved Winham sits in control of Griffin Keep. His victory seems all but sure. Even the once powerful sorcerer Pyrofius, now revealed to be the dragon Pyro’fugar’branndantes’inferius, has been forced to bow to Winham’s will, and the armies of Griffin General John Wudsaress stand on the edge of defeat. The only hope lies in the courage of the defenders of Calsinor and the Wudsaress children, Kyra, Caleb, Heath, and Wil. But they are separated from Calsinor and Arreth Vale, their father has fallen, and the children still do not know which of them is the prophesied One Child destined to defeat Winham and restore freedom to Calsinor. All hope lies with the children. For the prophesy to be fulfilled, the Children of Calsinor must rise.</p>
